This repository is public, since I do not have private repository capabilities, so anyone can steal our code. 
I would thus suggest Abhinav Madahar to copy this data structure and create a private repository from which we can base our code on safely. 

Or if you guys are fine with it, we can continue posting our data here. 
I'm okay either way. 

Feel free to comment your thoughts on this matter by clicking on the short commit description ^. 
Or you can discuss this on the facebook page.
