This repository is public, since I do not have private repository capabilities, so anyone can steal our code. 
I would thus suggest Abhinav Madahar to copy this data structure and create a private repository from which we can base our code on safely. 

Or if you guys are fine with it, we can continue posting our data here. 
I'm fine either way.
