This repository is public, since I do not have private repository capabilities, so anyone can steal our code. 
I would thus suggest Abhinav Madahar to copy this data structure and post it somewhere else. 

Or if you guys are fine with it, we can continue posting our data here. 
I'm fine either way; this is just a disclaimer.
